# Jenkins and docker integration

I followed [this](https://technology.riotgames.com/news/putting-jenkins-docker-container) guide from Riot Games to get started. 

# Getting Started

This being a `docker-compose` setup, it is very simple.

* Clone the repo
* `docker-compose build`
* `docker-compose up -d`

You can run `catPasswd.sh` for a quick and easy way to get your inital Jenkins setup password. 

All done!
